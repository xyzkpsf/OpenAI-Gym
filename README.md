On the MountainCar model, I implement the navie Q-learning method that with a Q table, using a exponential decay epsilon and linear decay learning rate.

After 200k episodes of training, the car is able to reach average -117 scores on a 100 trials test, condiering the official criterion of solven is lower than average -100 on 100 trials. I believe the navie should be above to solve the problem by a longer test or by keep tuning the hyperparameters.
